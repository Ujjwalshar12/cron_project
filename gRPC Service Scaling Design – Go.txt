# gRPC Service Scaling Design â€“ Go Implementation

## 1 Architecture Overview
The system is designed to handle 10,000 concurrent gRPC requests per second across multiple data centers. 

Key components:

- gRPC Service Layer (stateless)
- Load Balancer (global and local) 
- Paxos-based Consensus Algorithm(To keep replicas of data consistent databases, To handle failures (network issues, node crashes).
  To ensure reliability and fault tolerance)
- Message Queue / Job Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Persistent Storage (PostgreSQL, NoSQL)
- Multi-Data Center Deployment 
- Rate Limiting algorithm 
- Measuring Time & Space Complexity 
- Security (Encryption/Decryption)

## 2 Go Features for High-Concurrency

- Goroutines:
  - Lightweight threads in Go, used to handle each request concurrently.
  - Example:
    ```go
    go handleRequest(req)
    ```

- Channels:
  - Safe communication between goroutines.
  - Used for task queues and worker pools.
    ```go
    tasks := make(chan ReportTask, 1000)
    ```

- Worker Pools:
  - Limit concurrent processing to avoid overloading CPU/memory.
    ```go
    for i := 0; i < workerCount; i++ {
        go func() {
            for task := range tasks {
                processReport(task)
            }
        }()
    }```
   

- Context Handling:
  - gRPC requests include `context.Context` for cancellation and deadlines.
    ```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    ```

- Connection Pooling:
  - For DB and external services to prevent connection exhaustion.
    ```go
    db.SetMaxOpenConns(50)
    db.SetMaxIdleConns(25)
    db.SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Minute * 5)
    ```

- HTTP/2 & gRPC Streaming:
  - Efficient request multiplexing and large report streaming.

- Error Handling & Retries:
  - Use idiomatic Go error handling and retry logic for transient failures.


## 3 Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless gRPC Service in Go.
- Deploy in **Kubernetes** using **Argo CD** for GitOps-based deployment automation.
- Maintain service manifests, HPA configs, and namespace configurations in Git.
- Argo CD continuously syncs changes to the cluster.

## 4 SQL Optimization:
  - Ensure the database can handle high throughput by using proper indexing, prepared statements,stored procedure, connection pooling, and batching queries to reduce round-trips.
## 5 Monitoring & Logging:
  - Integrate Prometheus metrics to track CPU, memory, request rates, and error counts.
  - Use structured logging (zap or logrus) for all service events, including request start/end and errors.
